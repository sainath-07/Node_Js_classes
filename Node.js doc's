NODE JS

What is node.js ?

node.js is not a libary/framework/programming language it runtime environment, this runtime environment will execute javascript code by using the V8 engine.

node.js can connect with database
node.js internally use the javascript, code and syntax of node.js is similar very similar to javascript, but not exactlty same
node js free and open-source
node js uses chrome v8 engine to execute the code


paste image here

to check whether node.js and npm is installed 
-> node -v
-> npm -v



Difference between the node.js and javascript ?

node.js can connect with database but javascript can't connect with database
node.js can connect to database because it will run on the server-side.


Node.js run on the server side
JavaScript is run on the browser

both node.js and javascript syntax is very similar but not exactly the same.



Why do we use node ?

node js mostly used for API, Where we can create website
so we can connect the same database with web app, mobile app
Node JS is easy to understand who know javascript
Node JS is super-fast for API'S
with node and javascript we can become a full stack developer


Node JS is written in c,c++,javascript.
The latest version of Node.js is v22.3.0, which was released on June 11, 2024


What developer make with Node.js?

developer Make API with node.js
so we can connect server with client
node can make API for web, Android and IOS etc
with node js also we can make website but it is very rare mostly we make the Api's

How to write the node.js code in the cmd terminal ?

use command -- > node

start entering the code as like js (console.log("hello"))


code which we run in the browser and vs code terminal is different or same  ?

code which we run in the browser and vs code terminal is different because code executed in the browser is javascript code where console.log() is function of browser and in the terminal we don't have the browser so that is the reason both are different



File wise doc's

Export-import Day-01

1. we can't import and export as like the javascript in node.js

The require() function is a built-in function in Node.js that allows you to include modules in your code. A module is a reusable piece of code that can be exported from one file and imported into another. Modules can be used to organize your code, share code between different files, and make your code more reusable.


The require() function takes the path to a module as its argument and returns the module's exports object.



-------------------------------

Global modules,non-global modules,core modules Day-02

Core modules are a set of built-in modules that come with Node.js. These modules are available to use without any extra installation. They provide a variety of functionalities, such as interacting with the file system, networking, and creating web servers. Some examples of core modules include:
eg: console.log,fs,http,events etc..

fs: This module provides functions for interacting with the file system, such as reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, and getting file information.
http: This module provides functions for creating and managing HTTP servers and clients.
path: This module provides functions for working with file and directory paths.
os: This module provides functions for getting information about the operating system, such as the current user, the hostname, and the operating system type.
events: This module provides a way to create and manage events.


Global modules :
console.log() is the gloable moudles . here we dont need to import any file they are available in all of your project

Non global moudles :
fs is the non global moudles, here we need to import the moudles to use them in your code

Fs module :

The fs module in Node.js stands for File System. It provides access to the file system on your computer, allowing you to read and write files, create and delete directories, and more.
To use the fs module, you first need to import it into your code. This can be done using the require() method:



------------------

Http server Day-03

Https module will handle the server request and response in the nodejs

The HTTP module is a built-in module in Node.js that allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web, and it is used to exchange data between clients and servers.
The HTTP module provides a number of functions and classes that can be used to create HTTP servers and clients. For example, the createServer() function can be used to create an HTTP server, and the get() function can be used to make an HTTP request.


-------------------------------------
package.json day-04

we use the npm init command to initializes a project and create a package.json file that stores the metadata and dependencies. this package.json file makes easier to manage and share the project with others.

Node js is single threaded or multithreaded? 

node js is single threaded
node js can run at a time only one command.

nodemoudles or package should not be pushed into the git hub because it takes huges space to stores
 
to skip the pushing of the nodemoudles or package to git hub create .gitignore file and mention file followed by forward slash


Nodemon libary :


Nodemon is npm module or package it will automatically restart the node if there are any changes in the source code, it saves Time of developer and it doesn't effect the orignal code.

Nodejs is async, so that is the reason it works very fast.
