NODE JS

What is node.js ?

node.js is not a libary/framework/programming language it runtime environment, this runtime environment will execute javascript code by using the V8 engine.

node.js can connect with database
node.js internally use the javascript, code and syntax of node.js is similar very similar to javascript, but not exactlty same
node js free and open-source
node js uses chrome v8 engine to execute the code


paste image here

to check whether node.js and npm is installed 
-> node -v
-> npm -v



Difference between the node.js and javascript ?

node.js can connect with database but javascript can't connect with database
node.js can connect to database because it will run on the server-side.


Node.js run on the server side
JavaScript is run on the browser

both node.js and javascript syntax is very similar but not exactly the same.



Why do we use node ?

node js mostly used for API, Where we can create website
so we can connect the same database with web app, mobile app
Node JS is easy to understand who know javascript
Node JS is super-fast for API'S
with node and javascript we can become a full stack developer


Node JS is written in c,c++,javascript.
The latest version of Node.js is v22.3.0, which was released on June 11, 2024


What developer make with Node.js?

developer Make API with node.js
so we can connect server with client
node can make API for web, Android and IOS etc
with node js also we can make website but it is very rare mostly we make the Api's

How to write the node.js code in the cmd terminal ?

use command -- > node

start entering the code as like js (console.log("hello"))


code which we run in the browser and vs code terminal is different or same  ?

code which we run in the browser and vs code terminal is different because code executed in the browser is javascript code where console.log() is function of browser and in the terminal we don't have the browser so that is the reason both are different



File wise doc's

Export-import Day-01

1. we can't import and export as like the javascript in node.js

The require() function is a built-in function in Node.js that allows you to include modules in your code. A module is a reusable piece of code that can be exported from one file and imported into another. Modules can be used to organize your code, share code between different files, and make your code more reusable.


The require() function takes the path to a module as its argument and returns the module's exports object.



-------------------------------

Global modules,non-global modules,core modules Day-02

Core modules are a set of built-in modules that come with Node.js. These modules are available to use without any extra installation. They provide a variety of functionalities, such as interacting with the file system, networking, and creating web servers. Some examples of core modules include:
eg: console.log,fs,http,events etc..

fs: This module provides functions for interacting with the file system, such as reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, and getting file information.
http: This module provides functions for creating and managing HTTP servers and clients.
path: This module provides functions for working with file and directory paths.
os: This module provides functions for getting information about the operating system, such as the current user, the hostname, and the operating system type.
events: This module provides a way to create and manage events.


Global modules :
console.log() is the gloable moudles . here we dont need to import any file they are available in all of your project

Non global moudles :
fs is the non global moudles, here we need to import the moudles to use them in your code

Fs module :

The fs module in Node.js stands for File System. It provides access to the file system on your computer, allowing you to read and write files, create and delete directories, and more.
To use the fs module, you first need to import it into your code. This can be done using the require() method:



------------------

Http server Day-03

Https module will handle the server request and response in the nodejs

The HTTP module is a built-in module in Node.js that allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web, and it is used to exchange data between clients and servers.
The HTTP module provides a number of functions and classes that can be used to create HTTP servers and clients. For example, the createServer() function can be used to create an HTTP server, and the get() function can be used to make an HTTP request.


-------------------------------------
package.json day-04

we use the npm init command to initializes a project and create a package.json file that stores the metadata and dependencies. this package.json file makes easier to manage and share the project with others.

Node js is single threaded or multithreaded? 

node js is single threaded
node js can run at a time only one command.

nodemoudles or package should not be pushed into the git hub because it takes huges space to stores
 
to skip the pushing of the nodemoudles or package to git hub create .gitignore file and mention file followed by forward slash


Nodemon libary :


Nodemon is npm module or package it will automatically restart the node if there are any changes in the source code, it saves Time of developer and it doesn't effect the orignal code.

Nodejs is async, so that is the reason it works very fast.



----------

Day -05

creating the API by using the http module and createserver function method , this create server method will accept call back function here 1st parameter is request and 2nd parameter is response 

To create the API we need to use te response parameter 
1. resp.writeHead method 

The first argument of the res.writeHead() method is the status code, 200 means that all is OK, the second argument is an object containing the response headers.


2. resp.write("we need to pass the json data here by converting into json string use JSON.stringify()")


3. resp.end() 

end() will send the signal to server that all the header has been sent.


4. we need to use the listen method as a .listen() after the createserver() method 

inside the listen method we need to mention the any port number,


--------

Day-06

Taking the input from cmd line 

we need to use the process object and argv (argumentvector)
to collect input from the cmd line

and creating the file by importing the fs module


----------

Day-07


creating the fs moudles inside the new floder
here to create the file in the specific directory we need to import the path 

use the __dirname which will represent the current directory
with the path use the join method and include the __dirname as 1st arg, 2nd arg as the floder name where you want to create the file


created a multiple with loops 


to read the created files we need to use the readdir method because we have created the files in a another directory

The fs.readdir() function in Node.js is used to read the contents of a directory. It returns an array of the names of the files and subdirectories in the directory.


----

Day-08

crud operations with file system

1.fs.writeFileSync("filename","filecontent")


2.fs.readFile(filepath,'utf8',(err,filecontent)=>{
    console.log(filecontent)
})


3.fs.appened(filepath,"enter the content which you want to update",(err)=>{
   if(!err)  console.log("Updated successfully")
})

4. fs.unlinkSync(filepath)

Buffer is a tempory memory location
whenever we create the file or perfrom the any operation on file system. at that time node js requires some memory to perfrom the operations is called as Buffer.


Example of asynchronous programming

let a =10
let b=0

setTimeout(() => {
    b=10
    console.log("hello")
}, 1000);
console.log(a+b)


-------------------------------------

Express js

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.


GET method used in express js handle the INCOMING HTTP GET request
GET request will fetch the data from the server.

The GET method is also used for routing in Express. Routing is the process how an application responds to a client request.
app.get(path, callback)
path: A string representing the path of the route.
callback: A function that will be executed when the route is matched. This function has the parameters req (the request object) and res (the response object).


SEND method :


In Express.js, the send method is used to send a response to the client. This method is part of the response object (res) and can be used to send various types of data such as strings, JSON objects, buffers, and more. The send method also automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header based on the type of data being sent.

res.send([body])

body: The response body  can be of various types like String, Buffer, Object, Array, etc.

1. Sending a String Response
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

2.Sending a JSON Object
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
});


3.Sending a Buffer
const fs = require('fs');

app.get('/image', (req, res) => {
  const img = fs.readFileSync('./path/to/image.png');
  res.send(img);
});

4.Sending an HTML Response
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('<h1>About Us</h1><p>This is the about page.</p>');
});


----------------------------------

Making the html pages in node js

1. created the root page in node js and named as index.html it will consider that page as root page of the html


here use is the middle ware of express js
2. app.use(express.static(htmlpage)) --> follow this step to link the static file in our node js


3.  quesiton and answers


what is use of path module ?

path module will help us to access the folders of our project.

what is static method ?

static method will load the static pages which are .html files 


can we load the css,images ? in our html page

No we can't load the images or css direclty


how to create the 404 page in the nodejs ?

we need to pass the asterisk symbol (*) in place of path

How do you remove the extension from browser URL in the node.js ?

we need to use the sendFile method to remove the extension from brower URL.




------------------------>

template Engine

we use the template engine to create dynamic pages , to use template engine we need to install the npm package.

Ejs ?

EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node. js. The template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into the HTML template on the client side and produce the final HTML.


-------------------------->Doubts

1.can we load the css,images ? in our html page
2.
